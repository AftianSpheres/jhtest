Hammer testbed/prototyping whatsit.
Note that, provided the project continues, it's likely that (after a point) the public-facing repository will cease to be updated.

To build: download repo. Open Unity project - works in 5.3.5.3775. Hit the build button.
(Disclaimer: input config doesn't exist yet - everything is theoretically remappable, but you can't load or save the config file and the control config screen isn't implemented. Default settings right now have the game taking input from gamepad 1. It should work okay if you're using an XInput gamepad on Windows. Loading sensible defaults in other cases is on the to-do list.)
