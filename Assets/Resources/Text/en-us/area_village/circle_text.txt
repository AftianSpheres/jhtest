...You inspect the central stone, but nothing happens.

It looks like a piece is missing from this monolith.

...You realize that you have a stone fragment that might fit.
Try fitting the stone fragment to the monolith?

...You try to fit the fragment to the broken part of the monolith...

...It fits! ...The fragment affixes itself to the monolith.

...No good. Maybe it'll fit a different monolith...

...Maybe it's not a good idea to mess with these monoliths.

The monolith stands tall. It feels faintly warm to the touch.

...As you slip the fragment into the monolith, you feel an unearthly sensation.

The monolith is radiating an unnatural power.

When you touch the central stone, your hand slips through. You could probably step through this stone, if you wanted to try...

...Thinking better of it, you back away from the stone. As you do so, you somehow feel a sense of longing emanate from it.

The monolith has taken a twisted form. It's no longer warm to the touch.

The central stone has taken a twisted form. You touch it, but your hand doesn't go through.
